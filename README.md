## Ohio High Ability Students - Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes the identification of high ability (gifted) students across school districts in the state of Ohio. Using publicly available data from the Ohio Department of Education (2019–2023), we explored how geography and school funding influence the rate at which students are recognized as high ability.

### Project Highlights

- **Focus Areas**:
  - Relationship between district typology (urban, suburban, rural) and gifted identification rates
  - Correlation between per-pupil funding and gifted student counts
  - Visualization of disparities using box plots, decision trees, and regional comparison charts

- **Methods Used**:
  - Data mining (correlation analysis, clustering, decision trees using ID3)
  - Aggregation and visualization with Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

- **Key Findings**:
  - Suburban districts identify significantly more high ability students on average (12.7%) compared to urban (6.3%) and rural (4.8%) districts
  - Positive correlation (r = 0.47) between per-pupil funding and gifted identification
  - District population size had minimal impact on gifted identification rate

### Conclusion

This study highlights clear disparities in the identification of high ability students in Ohio based on geographic and financial factors. The results suggest a need for policy review and more equitable support for underrepresented districts.
